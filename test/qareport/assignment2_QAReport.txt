Functionality Testing:
Verify that the "Choose File" button opens the file browser dialog.
Test uploading different file types (e.g., text file, image file, PDF) and verify successful upload.
Test uploading files of various sizes to ensure there are no limitations or errors.
Verify that the "UPLOAD" button triggers the file upload process.
Check if the file is uploaded successfully and accessible on the server.
Test uploading multiple files simultaneously and ensure all files are uploaded correctly.
Verify that invalid or unsupported file types are not allowed for upload.

Usability Testing:
Ensure the file upload page has clear instructions on how to use the functionality.
Test the responsiveness of the page on different devices and screen sizes.
Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed if the file upload fails.
Check if there is a progress indicator during the upload process.
Verify that the uploaded file is displayed or linked properly after successful upload.

Security Testing:
Test for any security vulnerabilities like file path traversal attacks.
Check if the application enforces appropriate file size limitations to prevent abuse.
Verify that the uploaded files are stored securely and cannot be accessed or modified by unauthorized users.
Test if the application handles malicious file uploads (e.g., files containing malware or scripts).

Compatibility Testing:
Test the file upload functionality on different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and ensure consistent behavior.
Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to identify any platform-specific issues.
Verify the behavior of the file upload feature in different network conditions (e.g., low bandwidth, high latency).

Performance Testing:
Test the performance of file upload for various file sizes and measure the upload speed.
Monitor server response time during the file upload process and ensure it remains within acceptable limits.
Test the application's ability to handle a high volume of concurrent file uploads and check for any performance degradation.

//Test cases//

Verify the "Choose File" button functionality:
-Click the "Choose File" button and ensure that the file browser dialog opens.
-Cancel the file selection and verify that no file is uploaded.

Test successful file uploads:
-Upload a valid text file and verify that the file is uploaded successfully.
-Upload an image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and verify that the file is uploaded successfully.
-Upload a PDF file and verify that the file is uploaded successfully.
-Upload files of various sizes (small, medium, large) and verify successful upload.

Test unsupported file types:
-Attempt to upload a file with an unsupported file type (e.g., .exe, .mp3) and verify that an appropriate error message is displayed.
-Verify that the file upload is not allowed for file types other than text, image, or PDF.

Test file size limitations:
-Upload a file that exceeds the maximum file size limit and verify that an appropriate error message is displayed.
-Upload a file within the file size limit and ensure it is uploaded successfully.

Test multiple file uploads:
-Upload multiple files simultaneously and verify that all files are uploaded successfully.
-Verify that the correct number of files is displayed or linked after successful upload.

Test error handling:
-Disconnect the internet connection during file upload and verify that an appropriate error message is displayed.
-Upload a file with a filename that exceeds the maximum character limit and ensure it is handled correctly.

Security testing:
-Test for file path traversal attacks by attempting to upload files from outside the intended upload directory.
-Attempt to upload files with malicious content (e.g., files containing scripts or malware) and ensure they are blocked or handled securely.

Usability testing:
-Test the responsiveness of the file upload page on different devices and screen sizes.
-Verify that clear instructions are provided on how to use the file upload functionality.

Performance testing:
-Test the performance of file uploads for different file sizes and measure the upload speed.
-Simulate concurrent file uploads and verify that the system handles them effectively without performance degradation.
